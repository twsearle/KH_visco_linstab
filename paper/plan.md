PLAN FOR KH PAPER
=================

Introduction:
=============

* Brief rundown of the general idea

* Evidence for existence of viscoelastic turbulence

* Want to discover its nature

* inspired by progess made for Newtonian fluids, through study of exact solutions

* Preliminary work on the viscoelastic SSP

* Discussion of the source of the SSP in the Newtonian case being a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the streaks reinforcing the rolls.

* explicitly contrast this with the backwards step channel case

* what this paper is about - linear stability analysis of KH flow, the technique
    - Constituitive equations used

* overview of geometry 

* The key equations

The Purely Elastic Instability:
===============================

* For low Reynolds number and high Weissenberg number we see an instability grow at high k and move downwards in k. 

* The growth rate increases with increasing Weissenberg number.

* The instability becomes narrower as Wi increases. 

* plots to show all of these things.

* discussion of why the instability is supressed a bit at high Wiessenberg number. 

Confirming the model:
====================

Drag Reduction:
---------------

* We find the drag reduction phenomenon in our system

* Do we find the MDR?

Varying the width of the instability:
-------------------------------------

* We find the instability is insensitive to the width of the instability over a small range

* Reason for this - The walls of the channel are sufficiently distant that they do not affect the instability in the centre of the channel, and any instability at the walls of the channel is outweighed by the instability in the centre.

* Evidence both at high Reynolds number and low reynolds number high Wi

Consistency with FENE model:
----------------------------

* Finite extensibility model gives similar results at realistic values of L, the polymer length

* Instability robust on changing L. Appears amplified at very low L. Disappears as L -> 0  as expected?

Conclusion:
===========
